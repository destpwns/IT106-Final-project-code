When you run this code, you will be asked "Would you like to play?"

Input the character "Y" if you would like to continue, or "N" if you would like 
the code to exit.

If you decide to play it will ask for your name which will be whatever you input.

It will then ask "Swordsman or Mage" which will require you to decide which 
character you want to play. You must type out either full word (not case sensitive).

You will then be shown your Name, Health, and Class and present you with a random monster
with it's health and attack being displayed.

You will then be prompted with spells which vary depending on if you are a mage or 
swordsman. You select a spell by inputting the number next to it's name.If you are a 
swordsman, you have "Smack" and "Get Smacked". Smack deals, Get Smacked effectively 
does nothing (as a joke). Mages have four abilities which can be selected the same way. 
Each mage ability deals the same amount of damage unless they are used against a monster
who is particularly weak to that spell. Every monster except the troll has a weakness.
If you want to die quickly without waiting for stronger monsters, either choose Get 
Smacked or input any non listed number so that you don't kill the monster that you 
are fighting. 

Whenever you defeat a monster, you will be prompted to fully restore your
health or to upgrade your moves. Input the number next to either option to select it.
You can input anything else to do nothing if you wish to. You will then be prompted
with another monster and the cycle continues until you run out of health.
